#
# Some of these hosts must have the file "mpssh-ok.flag" created in the $HOME directory.
# Use the script "init-hosts.sh" to create this file where it is needed.
#
# Because the hostnames are statically predefined in the list files,
# we need to define them in "~/.ssh/config", in order to associate them with real hosts.
#
# All executed test commands are safe. They do not alter the file-system or do anything dangerous.
#
# Sample "~/.ssh/config" entries:
#
#Host test1.mpssh
#	Hostname my-server1.example.com
#Host test2.mpssh
#	Hostname my-server2.example.com

test1.mpssh
test2.mpssh
test3.mpssh
test4.mpssh
test50.mpssh
test6.mpssh
test7.mpssh
test8.mpssh
test9.mpssh
